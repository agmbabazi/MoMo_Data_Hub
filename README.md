# MoMo_Data_Hub

##  Project Overview

This project is an enterprise-level fullstack application designed to process, clean, and analyze MoMo SMS transaction data stored in XML format.  
The system parses raw SMS data, normalizes fields (dates, amounts, phone numbers), categorizes transactions, stores them in a relational database, and provides a frontend dashboard for analytics and visualization.

This is a **collaborative Agile project**, with tasks organized in a Scrum board and a shared GitHub repository for version control.


##  System Architecture

The system follows a modular **ETL + Database + Frontend** architecture:  
1. **Extract**: Parse MoMo SMS data from XML files.  
2. **Transform**: Clean, normalize, and categorize transactions.  
3. **Load**: Store structured data into SQLite.  
4. **Frontend**: Visualize analytics via a dashboard (charts, tables).
